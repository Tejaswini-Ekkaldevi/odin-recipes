        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This cake was sent home from our children's school. 
            It is the simplest, great tasting cake I've ever made. Great to make with the kids, especially for cupcakes.

                In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine flour and baking powder, add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Finally stir in the milk until batter is smooth. Pour or spoon batter into the prepared pan.
